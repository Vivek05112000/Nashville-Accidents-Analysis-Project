# Nashville-Accidents-Analysis-Project

Tools used - Power BI, DAX Queries

This is a very critical and sensitive dataset chosen by me to work upon to unravel some critical insights to know how these accidents have occurred and taken place in the city of Nashville over
the past 7 years (2018 - 2025)

Working on this dataset, I have come across several things that state how and when these accidents took place, at what time of the day, which day of the week experienced the most number of 
accidents, under which weather conditions, in which month and which year it was highest as well.

So let's dive into the project and insights discovered:

i> Total accidents took place -> 2,16,117 or 216K; A whooping number!!

ii> Total injuries -> 89K and Total fatalities -> 825

iii> Hit and Run accidents -> 57K; A huge number of accidents are hit and run, where people carelessely drive and then this kind of dangerous incident takes place!

iv> The year 2019 recorded the most number of accidents (38K), followed by the year 2018 (37K). Such alarming numbers!!

v> The 21st hour of the day, which is around 9 PM in the night, has experienced the most number of accidents.

vi> Friday experienced the most number of accidents over the span of 7 years!!

vii> The most common cause of accidents is when the vehicles of different people are getting hit from behind, that is: Front to Rear.

viii> South Precinct has the most number of injuries and casualities altogether.

ix> The month of March tops the list of experiencing the highest number of accidents.

x> Clear Daylight, Dark-Lighted and Cloudy weather conditions has seen the most number of accidents take place. So it tells us that during these conditions, when its likely to or about
    to rain, its better not to drive; prefer public transports for safety, and if not necessary, try to stay indoors.
